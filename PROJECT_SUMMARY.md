# ServiceNow Incident Management Project Summary

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive Incident Management module for ServiceNow using a Config-as-Code approach. It follows industry best practices for ITIL incident management and automates common processes to improve efficiency and reduce mean time to resolution.

## Key Components

1. **Business Rules**: Server-side automation for incident assignment, validation, and state management
2. **Client Scripts**: Form behavior management to guide users through the incident lifecycle
3. **Script Includes**: Reusable server-side functions for incident metrics and utilities
4. **UI Actions**: Custom buttons and menu items for incident management
5. **UI Policies**: Field behavior control based on incident state and context
6. **Notifications**: Email templates for incident events
7. **Integration**: REST APIs and external system integration
8. **SLA Management**: Comprehensive SLA framework for incident resolution
9. **Automated Testing**: ATF tests to validate functionality

## Architecture

The implementation follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Core Incident Logic**: Business rules and script includes for core functionality
- **User Interface**: Client scripts and UI policies for form behavior
- **Integration Layer**: REST APIs and integration scripts
- **Testing Framework**: ATF tests for validation
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployment using GitHub Actions

## Deployment

The project includes a complete CI/CD pipeline for deploying components to ServiceNow instances:

1. **Development**: Initial development and testing
2. **Test/QA**: Validation in a staging environment
3. **Production**: Controlled deployment to production

## Customization

The implementation is designed to be customizable with:

- Configuration files for SLAs and assignment rules
- Extensible script includes for custom business logic
- Well-documented components for easy modification

## Best Practices

This project follows ServiceNow best practices including:

- Proper error handling and logging
- Performance optimization for database queries
- Comprehensive documentation
- Test-driven development with ATF
- Modular, reusable design
