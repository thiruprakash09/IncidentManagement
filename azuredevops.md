# Using Azure DevOps Pipelines for ServiceNow Incident Management

Yes, you can definitely use Azure DevOps pipelines to implement CI/CD for your ServiceNow Incident Management implementation. Here's how to set it up:

## Getting Started with Azure DevOps CI/CD for ServiceNow

1. **Source Control**: First, ensure your ServiceNow customizations (scripts, workflows, etc.) are in source control
2. **Connection to ServiceNow**: You'll need a way to deploy to ServiceNow from Azure DevOps
3. **Pipeline Configuration**: Create YAML-based pipelines to automate testing and deployment

## Steps to Create CI/CD Pipeline

### 1. Set up Azure DevOps Project

1. Sign in to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com)
2. Create a new project or use an existing one
3. Push your ServiceNow code to the repository

### 2. Install ServiceNow Extensions

Install the [ServiceNow DevOps integration extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ServiceNow.now-azure-devops) from the marketplace.

### 3. Configure ServiceNow Connection

```yaml
# Example service connection usage in pipeline
steps:
- task: ServiceNowDevOpsPipeline@1
  inputs:
    connectedServiceName: 'ServiceNow-Connection' # Name of your service connection
    instanceName: '$(servicenow.instance)'
    operation: 'Run Pipeline'
    pipelineName: 'IncidentManagement Deployment'
```

For detailed setup instructions, see `.azuredevops/service-connection-setup.md`.

### 4. Define CI Pipeline for Testing

We've created a CI pipeline template in `.azuredevops/pipelines/ci-pipeline.yml` that includes:

- JavaScript linting
- ServiceNow configuration validation
- Jest unit tests
- ServiceNow ATF tests

Sample task:
```yaml
- task: ServiceNowDevOpsTest@1
  inputs:
    connectedServiceName: 'ServiceNow-Connection'
    testSuiteName: 'IncidentManagement Tests'
    instanceName: '$(servicenow.dev.instance)'
```

### 5. Define CD Pipeline for Deployment

We've created a CD pipeline template in `.azuredevops/pipelines/cd-pipeline.yml` that includes:

- Deployment package preparation
- ServiceNow deployment
- Change management integration

Sample task:
```yaml
- task: ServiceNowDevOpsDeploy@1
  inputs:
    connectedServiceName: 'ServiceNow-Connection'
    instanceName: '$(servicenow.test.instance)'
    applicationName: 'IncidentManagement'
    deploymentType: 'Standard Change'
```

## Best Practices for ServiceNow CI/CD

1. **Environment Strategy**: Use separate ServiceNow instances for development, testing, and production
2. **Automated Testing**: Write tests for your ServiceNow scripts and workflows
3. **Version Control**: Track all customizations in Git with meaningful commit messages
4. **Variable Groups**: Store sensitive information like credentials in Azure DevOps variable groups
5. **Approval Gates**: Add approval requirements before production deployments
6. **Change Management**: Integrate with ServiceNow Change Management process
7. **Pipeline Dashboard**: Create a dashboard to monitor pipeline status
8. **Documentation**: Document your pipeline setup and usage

## Getting Started

Follow our quick start guide in `.azuredevops/quickstart.md` to get up and running with:

1. Creating the Azure DevOps project
2. Setting up your ServiceNow connection
3. Creating variable groups
4. Setting up environments with approval gates
5. Running your first pipeline
