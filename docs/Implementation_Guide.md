# ServiceNow Incident Management Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document provides guidance on how to implement and deploy the Incident Management components in this repository to your ServiceNow instance.

## Components Overview

### 1. Business Rules

Business rules in ServiceNow are server-side scripts that run when records are displayed, inserted, updated, deleted, or queried. In this project, we've implemented several business rules to automate incident handling.

Key business rules include:
- Auto-assignment based on category
- State validation (preventing updates to closed incidents)
- Priority-based urgency setting

### 2. Client Scripts

Client scripts run in the user's browser and provide immediate feedback without requiring a round trip to the server. Our incident management system includes client scripts for:
- Field validation
- Dynamic form behavior
- User guidance and warnings

### 3. UI Policies & Actions

UI Policies control the behavior of fields on forms, while UI Actions provide custom buttons and context menu items:
- Field visibility/editability based on incident state
- Custom actions for escalation and reassignment
- Specialized buttons for common operations

### 4. Script Includes

Script Includes are reusable JavaScript functions accessible from server-side scripts:
- Incident metrics calculation
- Common utility functions
- Business logic encapsulation

### 5. Integration Components

Our incident management system integrates with external systems through:
- Scripted REST APIs
- REST Message operations
- Inbound integration handling

## Deployment Process

1. Clone this repository
2. Use ServiceNow Studio or Update Sets to import the components
3. Configure system properties as needed
4. Test functionality using the ATF tests provided

## Best Practices

- Always test in a sub-production instance before deploying to production
- Keep script functions modular and reusable
- Follow ServiceNow naming conventions
- Document custom scripts thoroughly with inline comments
