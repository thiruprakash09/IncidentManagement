# ServiceNow Incident Management Testing Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the testing approach for the Incident Management implementation, including manual testing procedures and automated tests.

## Automated Test Framework (ATF)

The `src/ATF` directory contains automated tests for key incident management functionality:

- Incident creation and assignment
- Business rule validation
- UI Action execution
- Integration testing

### Running ATF Tests

1. Import the ATF test files into your ServiceNow instance
2. Navigate to **Automated Test Framework > Tests**
3. Execute the test suite or individual tests

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Incident Creation
- [ ] Create new incident with minimal information
- [ ] Verify auto-assignment based on category
- [ ] Check default field values

### Incident Updates
- [ ] Update incident state through different lifecycle stages
- [ ] Verify state validation rules (e.g., closed incidents)
- [ ] Test reassignment functionality

### UI Validation
- [ ] Verify field visibility/editability based on incident state
- [ ] Test warning messages for urgent incidents
- [ ] Validate UI Actions (buttons) function correctly

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test outbound REST calls to external systems
- [ ] Verify inbound API functionality
- [ ] Check notification emails for format and content

## Performance Considerations

- Test with large datasets to ensure script performance
- Verify scheduled jobs complete within expected timeframes
- Check browser performance with complex client scripts
